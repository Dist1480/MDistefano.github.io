# Lyric Video

<p>This was a project that I completed back in grade 11, it is a lyric video animation of the popular Bruno Mars song, "24 karat gold". It is very fast pace, and incorporates associative elements, clever word animations, and continuity in animation. Click the picture below to give it a watch!</p>

    <h2>My Angle</h2>
    
This lyric video assignment is what really started my interest in the world of animation, how much fun it can be, and all the challenges that it can present. Through this long process, gained a newfound respect for those who pursue animation as a career path. It took me over a week to learn how to use Adobe After Effects and to create just a short one minute video, so I cannot even begin to imagine how much time it would take to create even longer videos that are more fast paced than mine. If I were able to do this project again, I would choose a song with less words per minute, and a slower bmp, as that would lighten the load that I would be partaking on. Despite this, the hard work pays off immensely in the final product, when I was finally finished, the satisfaction I felt was worth all the effort I had put into the project.
