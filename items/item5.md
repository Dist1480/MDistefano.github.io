# Graphics #

 Throughout my academic career I have worked on a multitude of different graphics, where it be in Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator they are all included here. These graphics include infographics for online course material, Magazine Covers, Business Cards, and many more! <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dc5m501HzIAzkXhxxjN7iHAUVrNfKQjW?usp=sharing" style="color: #6161FF" target="_blank">Click here to see my repository</a>

    <h2>My Angle</h2>
    
Graphic design is something that I have been interested in since grade 9, where I was first taught how to use tools that are the source of an infinite creative outlet. It has been 7 years since than, and each year I add something now to my portfolio, and with each new addition comes a story. Most recently, I created an info-graphic that was to be included in a section of a video on clastic sediment. <img src = "/img/Clastic Sediment.jpg" alt = "Clastic Sediment Graphic" style="padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em"> </br>
I created this graphic that was entirely different than a reference image provided to me, and in solving some of the many technical problems that I encountered I expanded my knowledge of the tool I used to create it, Adobe Illustrator. Graphic design is the learn as you go process, as you will never be able to truly learn how to make something unless you experiment with the tools at your disposal, and learn from experience. If you would like to see more of what I have created, please view my <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Dc5m501HzIAzkXhxxjN7iHAUVrNfKQjW?usp=sharing" style="color: #6161FF" target="_blank">graphic design repository!</a>
