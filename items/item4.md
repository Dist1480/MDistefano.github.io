Throughout my academic career, I have made a plethora of animations, using software such as Adobe After Affects, and Vyond. Below, is a link to a google drive folder, containing of the videos I have worked on.

    <h2>My Angle</h2>
    
Animation is a way for me to bring my graphic design creations to life during my 2020 co-op, I was able to work on some animations through Vyond and Adobe After Affects, that further expanded my appreciation for the craft. It takes a lot of time to animate something, the ratio of time imputed to result outputted is massive, and held true in my effort to create a video that shows us how we can be inclusive of everyone around us.
