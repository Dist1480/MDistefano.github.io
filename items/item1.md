# Mock App Development Process

<p>This year, I was tasked to design a solution that could assist students in online collaboration during this global pandemic. This project was cumulative, and is composed of 4 parts, each done as the semester progressed, each assignment building off the foundations of the previous. There is a link to a google drive folder, containing all the artifacts I created</p>
