<h1>Mock App Development Process</h1>

This year, I was tasked to design a solution that could assist students in online collaboration during this global pandemic. This project was cumulative, and is composed of 4 parts, each done as the semester progressed, each assignment building off the foundations of the previous. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10qteyM_kkmsigNvrSW1hDJA9cdaql40Y?usp=sharing" style="color: #6161FF;" target="_blank">Click here to see my repository</a> containing all the artifacts I created, or click on the image below to see how I went about tackling this task.

        <h2>My Angle</h2> 
        
I really enjoyed the process of making this assignment, I had always known that user feedback is important, but as I went through each deliverable I learned so many things about what makes a design suitable for it's intended audience, and how the input of the user really shapes the overall design of any solution. I gained a new understanding of the design process, it is a long, iterative process that should include the user in each stage, as they are what brings the design to life. I feel that I have developed a new sense of appreciation of what it takes to design an experience, even for something like a mock app.
