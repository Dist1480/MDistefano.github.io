# Closed Captioning Projects #

<p> During my summer co-op at OpenED working at the University of Guelph, I had the opportunity to explore many different types of software, as well as becoming familiar with how to make online content more accessible for everyone. In doing that, I learned how to provide accessible video for those with hearing impairments </p>

    <h2>My Angle</h2>
    
This co-op gave me the most fulfillment that I have ever had in my academic career. I was able to contribute to the learning of other students, in the creation of content that I truly enjoyed making, most of these projects are included in my graphic design and animation repositories. This also came with one of the more mentally demanding tasks, manual closed captioning. Part of my job at this co-op placement, was to create content that is accessible to anyone and in this, I was tasked with creating closed captions from scratch, for a handful of given videos. This video is a result of my labor, and through the hours I spent making sure that these captions are not only communicating what is being said in the video, but also providing these impaired users with an experience, where the closed captions more than what is being said, I gained a new perspective on making content accessible is vital to creating something that can be understood by everyone.
