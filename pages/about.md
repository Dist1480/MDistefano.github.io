# About Me #

<p>
Hi, I'm Matteo, a transfer student previously in second year Software Engineering at the University of Guelph, now a UX Design student at Wilfred Laurier University. I live in Whitchurch-Stouffville when I am not at school, and have been passionate about creating for as long as I can remember. I like to play video games, watch soccer, and work on my own projects! If you want to take a look at some of these projects here they are below

Enjoy!
